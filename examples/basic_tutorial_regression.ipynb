    "# Basic tutorial: regression task\n",
    "#### Author: Matteo Caorsi\n",
    "\n",
    "This short tutorial provides you with the basic example of regression.\n",
    "Regression tasks can be performed in *giotto-deep* as easily as classification ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of a regression task in similar to a classificaiton one, with the difference that the space of classes is infinite! Hence, we cannot really ho to extend the losses and metrics of classificaiton tasks directly to regressions ones: however, the models, the training, th optimisation,... remain basically the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](./images/regression.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will try to fit a line in a 3D space: not super exciting indeed, but then you can have fun and use these tools to fit the curves in the *forex market* for example!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of the tutorial are the following:\n",
    " 1. creation of a dataset\n",
    " 2. creation of a model\n",
    " 3. define metrics and losses\n",
    " 4. run trainig\n",
    " 5. visualise results interactively"
