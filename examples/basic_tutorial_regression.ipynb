    "# Basic tutorial: regression task\n",
    "#### Author: Matteo Caorsi\n",
    "\n",
    "This short tutorial provides you with the basic example of regression.\n",
    "Regression tasks can be performed in *giotto-deep* as easily as classification ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of a regression task in similar to a classificaiton one, with the difference that the space of classes is infinite! Hence, we cannot really know how to extend the losses and metrics of classificaiton tasks directly to regressions ones: however, the models, the training, the optimisation,... remain basically the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](./images/regression.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will try to fit a line in a 3D space: not super exciting indeed, but then you can have fun and use these tools to fit the curves in the *forex market* for example!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of the tutorial are the following:\n",
    " 1. Creation of a dataset\n",
    " 2. Creation of a model\n",
    " 3. Define metrics and losses\n",
    " 4. Run trainig\n",
    " 5. Visualise results interactively"
