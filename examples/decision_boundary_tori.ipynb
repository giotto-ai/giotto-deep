    "# Computation of decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this short notebook we describe how to use giotto-deep to compute the decision boundary of a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the algorithm is to use gradient descent to push a certain amount of input poits towards the boundary of the classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we are computing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial || M(x) - 1/2||^2}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the model whose output is the softmax, and $x$ the input. If teh output is $1/2$, it means that the model is undecided between the two classes at hand: this is the decison bounday.\n",
