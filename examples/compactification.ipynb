    "# Compatification of spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Author: Matteo Caorsi\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing decision boundaries is not an easy task, especially given the fact that the feature space is non compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "On compact spaces it is easier to work, as they are close and bounded (Heine-Borel). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose here a method to compactifiy the feature space $\\mathbb R^n$ to the projective space $\\mathbb RP^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary, gets therefore sampled in each chart of $\\mathbb RP^n$ uniformly. When charts are put together, the resulting point cloud (defined abstractly via a dissimilarity matrix `d_final`), can be used to compute the topology of the *compactified* decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the topology so obtained can be further exploited for regularisation purposes."
