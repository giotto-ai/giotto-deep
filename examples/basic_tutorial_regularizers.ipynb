    "\n",
    "Regularization is a powerful tool that aims to combat overfitting the data. If we want a model that is flexible enough to fit complex data, we need many parameters. In these cases it may be that there are multiple choices for the parameters to fit the data very well, and the the problem becomes ill-defined - there is no unique solution. When this is the case, we may introduce preference to a model that is in some way simpler, and we may do this with the help of a *regularizer*. This is the subject of this notebook.\n",
